# Kindle Fire HD 7" (2012)
Tate PVT 08

This is a discontinued Android-based tablet by Amazon. The latest system version
is 7.5.1. It runs Fire OS, this version being based on Android 4. This tablet
was the 2nd generation in the Fire Tablet series. The one I'm using has an
internal storage capacity of 16 GB.
